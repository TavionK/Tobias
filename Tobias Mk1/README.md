# *Tobias Mk1*

[GitHub - TavionK/Tobias-Mk1: First version of my personal assistant](https://github.com/TavionK/Tobias-Mk1)

### *Background Information*

This is my very own attempt at creating my own personal assistant which I have named *Tobias*, short for Tavion's Original But Intelligent Artificial System. The goal of this is to be a long term project with different versions as I continue to learn and explore the world of Artificial Intelligence.

### *Mk1*

The Mk1 version Is not supposed to be a live learning "artificial intelligence," he is simply a program that is able to take in voice commands and call the appropriate function. I wouldn't call the Mk1 version artificial intelligence yet but rather just simply blind intelligence as it does what it is asked without any artificial thinking.

### *Final Thoughts*

This was a good start to a long process of creating an AI. Over the course of this project I was able to create a fully functional personal assistant that was able to execute all of the requirements above. There are some things that I wanted to implement but decided it was best not to implement in this version. Email was a function I wanted but having him to differentiate between uppercase and lowercase would've proven to be a difficult task as well as anyone being in the room could send an email from my account. I also wanted to have Tobias control my smart plugs in order to turn on and off my lights but I could not find a way to have this work. The next step for [*Tobias Mk2*](https://www.notion.so/Tobias-Mk2-d0cd9f77e8204694acb856968a47c8e3) is for him to actually be an AI, with that being said I think is was a good step in the right direction and am looking forward to what this project can become, time to get back to work!
